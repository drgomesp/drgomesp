### Daniel Ribeiro
>  "What I cannot create, I do not understand" — Richard Feynman

👋 Hey there! I'm Daniel, a self-taught programmer who likes to build things from scratch
in order to understand how they work. Some topics of interest to me are network
protocols, hardware emulation, compilers, game engines, graphics, decentralized 
technology, just to name a few.
